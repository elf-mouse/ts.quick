## TypeScript in the browser

If you are using TypeScript to create a web application here are my recommendations:

### General Machine Setup

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Project Setup

- Create a project dir

```sh
mkdir your-project
cd your-project
```

- Create `tsconfig.json`. We discuss _modules_ here. Also good to have it setup for `tsx` compilation out of the box.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es5",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "sourceMap": true,
      "jsx": "react"
  },
  "exclude": [
      "node_modules"
  ],
  "compileOnSave": false
}
```

- Create an npm project:

```sh
npm init -y
```

- Install TypeScript-nightly, webpack, [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/), typings

```sh
npm install typescript@next webpack ts-loader typings --save-dev
```

- Init typings (creates a `typings.json` file for you).

```sh
"./node_modules/.bin/typings" init
```

- Create a `webpack.config.js` to bundle your modules into a single `bundle.js` file that contains all your resources:

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/app.tsx',
  output: {
      filename: './dist/bundle.js'
  },
  resolve: {
      // Add `.ts` and `.tsx` as a resolvable extension.
      extensions: ['', '.webpack.js', '.web.js', '.ts', '.tsx', '.js']
  },
  module: {
      loaders: [
          // all files with a `.ts` or `.tsx` extension will be handled by `ts-loader`
          { test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: 'ts-loader' }
      ]
  }
}
```

- Setup an npm script to run a build. Also have it run `typings install` on `npm install`. In your `package.json` add a `script` section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepublish": "typings install",
  "watch": "webpack --watch"
},
```

Now just run the following (in the directory that contains `webpack.config.js`):

```sh
npm run watch
```

Now if you make edits to your `ts` or `tsx` file webpack will generate `bundle.js` for you. Serve this up using your web server ðŸŒ¹.

### More

If you are going to use React (which I highly recommend you give a look), here are a few more steps:

```sh
npm install react react-dom --save-dev
```

```sh
"./node_modules/.bin/typings" install dt~react --global --save
"./node_modules/.bin/typings" install dt~react-dom --global --save
```
